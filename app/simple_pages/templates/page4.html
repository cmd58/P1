     <h2>Here are some key terms to remember when thinking about CI/CD:</h2>
     <p><b>CI</b> - a software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.</p>
     <p><b>CD</b> - a software development methodology that constitutes making updates continuously, piece-by-piece, enabling software code to be delivered to customers as soon as it is completed and tested.</p>

     <h2>So what is meant CI/CD as a whole?</h2>
     <p>Continuous Integration is the practice of testing each change done to your codebase automatically and as early as possible. Continuous Deployment follows the testing that happens during Continuous Integration and pushes changes to a staging or production system.</p>
     <h2>And what is GitHub Actions</h2>
     <p>GitHub Actions is an automation tool which gives developers CI/CD capabilities right next to your code in GitHub.</p>
